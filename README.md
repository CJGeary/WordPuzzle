SitePoint Basic JavaScript Tutorial Challenge

Introduction:

The goal of this app is to learn the basics of Javascript. I followed a tutorial on Sitepoint from David Green. To complete the course I had to do the following challenge:

 1  Create a program that fills in the blanks of a story template.
 2  Randomize the order in which the script inserts the missing words. So each time you run it the outcome is unique.
 3  Modify the script so that words are not being repeated.
 4  Consider what happens if you run out of words. How can you prevent that from breaking your program.
 5  Incorporate real user input. Use a series of prompts to collect nouns, adjectives and verbs to fill out the missing words in the story template.
 6  Deploy it and style it using HTML and CSS.
